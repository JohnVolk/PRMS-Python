Hey guys! Here is a start, I added some files that you can start working with
specifically the essential files to run PRMS. There are three models as of now
that we will be able to test code against: two from the USGS called 'acf' and 'merced'
and my MS thesis model 'lbcd'. It might be easier to start with lbcd because I have converted
the text files and tested it to run on Linux. It also already has an output file ready. 

Try to run PRMS with any of the three models, let me know if you have issues. There is
a README file in each directory and there is instructions on running it if you have issues. 

More to come, including example notebooks for each task! 

Cheers -John
