I've included the newest release of PRMS: version 4.0.1 and the previous commonly used version (3.0.5) 
in windows and linux. The actual formatting of the files we will be working with should not have changed 
between these new versions or the previous versions (3.X.X). These are just here to make it convenient 
for your system so I grabbed them all. Don't forget that when you run PRMS at the command line you need
to give it the control file as an argument:

$prms controlfilename.control

and in this case the control file should be in the same directory. One exception to this is if the control 
file is named prms.control then all you need to do is run: $prms or $./prms on Linux.
